FairCLIP: Harnessing Fairness in Vision-Language Learning. OphGLM aims to enhance ophthalmic diagnostics by integrating visual and language models, improving human-computer interaction and clinical applicability. SMART-LLM: Smart Multi-Agent Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models. Surgeyos is an open-source initiative unifying hardware, mechanical designs, electronics, software, and AI for medical robotics, VR simulation, and beyond. The ROS for Medical Robotics (ROS-MED) Project is an open-source software project to provide an open-source software platform for medical robotics research. SurRoL is an open-source Reinforcement Learning Centered and dVRK Compatible Platform for Surgical Robot Learning. OpenDR is a modular, open and non-proprietary toolkit for core robotic functionalities by harnessing deep learning. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. Data processing programs for the vision-based tactile sensor FingerVision. OpenSim is a freely available and user-extensible software system that allows users to develop models of musculoskeletal structures, create dynamic motion simulations, and can be used to assist in surgery planning for children with cerebral palsy. iMSTK is an open-source C++-based software toolkit for real-time physics-based surgical simulations. SOFA is an open-source framework for interactive mechanical simulation, with an emphasis on biomechanics and robotics. Clara is a forward-chaining rules engine written in Clojure(Script) with Java interoperability. 3dbiotechDentalCAD is a 3D modeling software focused on the dental sector based on the open-source project Open Dental. ODC is the open-source dental CAD solution for Blender.
